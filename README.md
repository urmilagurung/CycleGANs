# CycleGANs

## Overview
This project utilizes CycleGANs to perform image-to-image translation tasks. The goal is to learn the mapping between an input image and an output image using a training set of aligned image pairs.

## Features
- **Data Preparation**: Scripts for unzipping and organizing datasets.
- **Image Processing**: Functions for loading, normalizing, and preprocessing images.
- **Model Training**: Code for setting up CycleGAN models, loss functions, and training loops.
- **Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing the results of the image translation.
